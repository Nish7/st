## Smalltalk

### Installation
- Using GNU Smalltalk 3.2.5
- Avoiding the Pharo due to the size of the image and the complexity of the environment
- All `.st` are scripts that can be run with `gst <script>.st`
- `gst` is the GNU Smalltalk interpreter.
- Documentation: [GNU Smalltalk](https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/manual-base/gst.html)

**Note**: The scripts are not using the Smalltalk dialects of Pharo or Squeak. They are using the GNU Smalltalk dialect.
